        <p>When a trusted professor sexually assaulted her during a private Pilates lesson, Jessica Altchiler, normally outspoken and gregarious, kept the assault private for two years.</p>

        <p>“I didn’t tell a soul, because I was so mortified about what happened,” Altchiler said. “The tricky thing, and why it took me so long to say something, was that it didn’t feel sexual. He was doing it from such a manipulative place of ‘I have this power and I’m treating you.’”</p>

  <iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/417349197&color=%2300aabb&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
        <p>Altchiler met her abuser, a male dance professor*, at Marymount Manhattan College, where she double majored in dance and psychology. In her senior year, Altchiler told the professor about a string of dance-related injuries. So he offered to give her private Pilates lessons to treat the issues.</p>

        <p>“We had about four lessons that were absolutely incredible,” Altchiler said. “I left feeling on top of the world. What’s interesting, is that I was alone in this room with this man and I had no doubt about it. I had no voice inside saying ‘Oh, maybe you shouldn’t do this,’ because I trusted him that much. He was my teacher, my mentor.”</p>

        <p>Towards the end of her fifth lesson, the instructor started to massage Altchiler’s iliotibial band, a strip of tissue that runs from the knee to the outside of the hip, connecting the shin to the pelvis.</p>

        <p>“As a dancer, you don’t really think twice about someone massaging your IT band,” Altchiler said. “And it makes sense, because it’s what we were working on.”</p>

        <p>Eventually, the professor reached inside her underwear, groping her genitals, Altchiler said. “I was completely shocked and paralyzed,” she said. “I kept telling myself, this isn’t happening. I successfully shut myself down to feel that nothing was going on in that moment.”</p>

        <p>Altchiler said her interactions with him were professional and friendly leading up to the assault. She took several of his classes and interned at a summer dance program he ran for adults with mental and physical disabilities. According to the National Institute of Justice, 85 to 90 percent of sexual assaults reported by college women are committed by someone known to the victim.</p>

        <p>She also said her assault echoed descriptions given by some of the estimated 250 victims of Larry Nassar, former USA Gymnastics team doctor and osteopathic physician at Michigan State University. Nassar was convicted of multiple counts of child pornography and sexual assaulting girls and young women, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas during medical examinations.</p>

        <p>“I’m so grateful for everybody in the #metoo movement, but particularly Aly Raisman,” Altchiler said. “Because after I heard her speak, I felt connected to that. And I understood what it feels like to really want to believe that someone’s trying to help you when you’re being taken advantage of. And you’re being manipulated. And you’re being sexually assaulted.”</p>

        </div>

        <p>It was the #metoo movement that inspired Altchiler to report the assault to her college at the end of 2017.</p>

        <p>Altchiler said third-party investigators interviewed her and the professor separately, before ultimately deciding to fire him. Under Title IX, a federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education, colleges that receive federal funding must investigate allegations of sexual violence and harassment.</p>

        <p>“It helped me find some kind of purpose in it,” Altchiler said. “The fact that I didn’t deserve to go through that and no one else does. In some way, I can use my voice and the story of what happened to help other people tell their stories, shine a light on what this man did to me and also—it’s very common. It’s way more common we think. It’s way more common than people talk about. And that’s why this movement has been so incredible.</p>

        <p>*Altchiler did not disclose the name of the professor.</p>
